Don’t hit a wall and don’t bite your own tail.

Crashing into a wall or your tail will end the game immediately.

10 points will be added to the player’s score for eating the fruit (@).

The player’s total score is calculated based on the number of fruits the snake consumed.

The length of the snake will be increased after eating the fruits.
